# Week 2: Digital Logic System
**Basic Logic Gates, Electronic Circuit Interfacing, Basic ALU, 7 segment display, ICs based interfacing application.**

*Example: Interfacing a 7 segment display with Arduino. Numbering sequence from 0 to 9.*

## Materials needed:
- Arduino Uno board
- Common cathode 7-segment display
- 220-ohm resistors (7 of them)
- Pushbuttons (2 or more)
- Jumper wires
- Breadboard
- Circuit Setup:

## Experiment Steps:
1. Build the circuit according to the circuit setup instructions.
2. Upload the provided Arduino code to your Arduino Uno.
3. Open the Serial Monitor in the Arduino IDE.
4. Press the increment button to increase the count. The 7-segment display should show the numbers from 0 to 9 sequentially.
5. Press the reset button to reset the count to 0.

This simple experiment helps :+1: you understand how to interface a 7-segment display with an Arduino Uno and how to control it manually using buttons. You can extend this experiment by adding more functionality or additional displays for more complex projects ðŸ˜‰.
