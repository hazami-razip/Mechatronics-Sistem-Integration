# Module for Week 3:
Parallel, Serial and USB interfacing with microcontroller and computer based system (1):
Sensors and actuators.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>**Using the Arduino Serial Plotter**: Please note that if you are working with Python to read data
from your Arduino, it's important not to open the Arduino Serial Plotter simultaneously.

> [!TIP]
>If you intend to use Python to read and process data from the Arduino, ensure that the Serial Plotter is ***closed*** or ***not in use*** while running
your Python script to maintain uninterrupted communication between Python and the Arduino.

## Week 3a: 
**In this experiment, we want to send potentiometer readings
from an Arduino to a Python script through a USB connection.**

## Week 3b: 
**Controlling a servo motor using Python involves interfacing with an Arduino board that's connected
to the servo.**
